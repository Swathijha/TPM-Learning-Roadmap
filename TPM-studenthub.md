# TPM Learning Roadmap by Swathi

👋 Hi! I’m Swathi, currently working as a Scrum Specialist in fintech and on a journey to become a Technical Program Manager (TPM), ideally at a company like Google.

Although I’m not a developer, I work closely with engineers, QAs, and business teams to deliver high-impact projects in payments and compliance. This repo tracks my progress in gaining technical fluency and growing into a TPM role.

## 📚 What I'm Learning:
- Google Cloud Fundamentals
- CI/CD and DevOps Concepts
- System Design Basics
- SQL for TPMs
- Agile at Scale & Technical Program Management best practices

## 🗓️ Weekly Progress:
I’ll document my learnings, insights, and questions week by week in separate .md files.

## 🎯 Goal:
To build the technical understanding, leadership skills, and confidence needed to succeed in a TPM or Agile Program Manager role at Google or similar tech-driven organizations.
